Yesterday I received an interesting phishing email.
<br />
I did the research and found out it's actually a good learning case,
since attacker's server demonstrates excellent practice in network security.
<br />
Today's goal is to attack phishing server by mimicing victims.
<br />
#### Below is the email content

<br />
As you can see, the attacker just attached a copy image to mimic Amazon site

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```css
code[class*="language-"],
pre[class*="language-"] {
	color: black;
	background: none;
	font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Andale Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;
	text-align: left;
	white-space: pre;
	word-spacing: normal;
	word-break: normal;
	word-wrap: normal;
	line-height: 1.5;

	-moz-tab-size: 4;
	-o-tab-size: 4;
	tab-size: 4;

	-webkit-hyphens: none;
	-moz-hyphens: none;
	-ms-hyphens: none;

}
